First, a definition. A 'true' A.I. (TAI) is one that roughly passes the Turing test, or one that at least has human
or super-human-level performance for a given task, and performs that task in a human-like manner, i.e. its
failure modes are statistically identical to a human's.

One of the biggest problems in building a 'true' A.I. is that humans learn how to perform tasks in an extremely
interconnected and self-referential way. I.e. multiple skills are trained simultaneously, and knowledge in one
area intimately informs understanding of another. Furthermore, an adult human is the culmination of 20 years of
such training.

The models used in modern neural networks, and the training sets involved usually tend to be goal-oriented. By
this I mean that these algorithms have biases introduced by the assumptions made by the developer about how a
certain A.I. should behave.

Two possible solutions for this issue are: (1) to create an algorithm that learns the way a human learns, i.e. the
holy grail of A.I., or (2) design an algorithm that has as few biases as possible.

Since option (1) is the collective goal of the entire research community I will focus on option (2) here. In a
sense, following option (2) would be doing the same thing everyone has been doing for years - trying to be more
clever in designing neural networks. However we will try to rebuild some of the standard building blocks to make
the algorithm more flexible and human-like.
